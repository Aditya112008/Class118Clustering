Clustering : K-means algorithm 

WCSS perimeter to evaluate the choice of K
W - Within 
C - Clusters
S - Sum of
S - Sqaures

This means we are going to choose a center point for a cluster from where all the points falling inside that cluster will be closest
Then we will caluculate the distance of all points from the center 
Add up all the distances and then note the values 

Repeat the process for another two center points and find the centroid which has minimum sum of all the distances
